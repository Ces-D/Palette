# Palette

## Purpose

Palette is a color theme generator for web designers, inspired by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/generate) and [HappyHues](https://www.happyhues.co/). Users will be able to create their palette of colors using various
color types (rgb, hex, hsl) or pick a single color and have the program decide on the rest of the palette based on color theory and color harmonies. Users will also be able to visualize the purpose of their chosen colors respective to a basic web page. Header colors, highlight colors, text colors based on importance, buttons, etc. are just a few examples of the purpose of color. The application will be able to store the palettes of a user and let others explore the already created palettes to find inspiration.
